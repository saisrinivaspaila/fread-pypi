        ### Why to use?
        
        There are people like me, who use python for competitive programming or for building console based applications. When I use my local editors, I need to enter the code from the console everytime. There are ways I can change it to file input based, for which I need to refactor a lot of code during submissions.
        So this package helps us to take inputs directly from files with the same code that we write for interactive console. With one line command, we can change the code from interactive console to file based input.
        
        I hope you people will find it is useful.
        
        ### How to use?
        
        ##### installing
        
            pip install fread
        
        ##### how to use in code
        
            from fread import get_input
            get_input.fileInput(mainPythonFile, yourInputTextFile)
        
        ##### Example
        
        main.py:
        
            from fread import get_input
            get_input.fileInput("main.py","input.txt")
            n1 = int(input())
            n2 = int(input())
            print("sum:",n1+n2)
            str1 = input()
            print("string:",str1)
            list1 = map(int,input().split())
            print("list:",list1)
        
        input.txt:
        
            1
            2
            python is love, Happy Coding
            1 2 3 4
        
        output:
        
            sum: 3
            string: python is love, Happy coding
            list: [1,2,3,4]
